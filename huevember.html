            <p><span class="yellow-text">overview //</span> I had a lot of fun with this project. The goal was to create one piece of art every day of November using a set of 30 preselected hues. I love working with limited colour palettes, and Huevember was a great exercise to learn more about colour theory (and to fiddle around with this lineless style).</p>

            <p><span class="yellow-text">process //</span> I only planned out which member in which outfit I wanted on each day; the pose and palettes were created day to day. I treated every 2 days as a pair, partly to ease pressure if I fell behind a day and partly to encourage more variance between pieces. If everyone was at a 3/4 angle looking left that would be quite boring! Then, since I wanted each of the four K/DA members to have an equal amount of pieces, I featured two characters each in the last two days. Those days are also the only ones where I designed the outfits, and it was freeing to end the project drawing whatever I wanted.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow-text">reflection and learnings //</span> Looking back I can see that the later pieces have more details and attention to form than some of the earlier pieces, marking some improvement, though I feel the pieces in the middle around the dark blue section are the weakest—the contrast between the lightest and darkest shades is not enough, and many of the details are lots because of this. I also discovered how much fun it was to detail baggy sleeves and jackets on day 5. Some of them turned out better than others, but I'm especially proud of Akali's jacket on day 28.</p>

            <p class="small">better use of contrast; less effect on readability even when contrast is low</p>

            <p>Design wise, my biggest lesson about colour theory was how much the hue of a colour changes the mood of the whole piece. For instance, even though the provided hue was at the same point on the colour picker, all the violets and blues seem much “darker” than the yellows and limes. As well, since I was limited to a single hue, I had to learn how to better use tints and shades instead of relying on multiply layers and hue shifting. While “don't shade with black” is still deeply ingrained into me, it's also important to learn when and how to break the rules.</p>
