            <p><span class="yellow-text">overview //</span> The first release of League's Battle Academia skinline has my entire heart. Since I wanted to try my hand at designing some fanskins, I chose four champions I thought would make for an interesting “friend group” in this skinline's universe and created both outfit and weapon concepts for all of them. My goal was to stay faithful to the style and feeling of the original skinline, but bring in some unique design points as well to avoid the cut-and-paste feeling that can come with school uniform designs.</p>

            </div>

            <p><span class="yellow-text">process //</span> I started with some rough doodles to narrow down the champions to design. Since I knew I definitely wanted Aphelios, I designed his guns using battle academia Katarina and Yone as references for the style of weapons. I then ended up choosing Samira over Diana since I found designing this style of weapons fun, and Samira has three weapons vs Diana having one. I also did the weapons for Sett and Seraphine, though I still haven't gotten around to Seraphine's stage.</p>

                <img src="battle academia/ba fanskins weapon moodboard.png" alt="collage of screenshots of video game characters">
            </div>

            <p class="small">I referenced these images for the general "feel" of the weapons <a class="bodylink" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Jl3r1Z"><span class="yellow-text"><u>[1]</u></span></a> <a class="bodylink" href="https://imgur.com/a/oeUUkpJ"><span class="yellow-text"><u>[2]</u></span></a> <a class="bodylink" href="https://twitter.com/league_ref/status/1366967082731118593"><span class="yellow-text"><u>[3]</u></span></a></p>

            <p>Next I designed the first iteration of outfits. I wanted one champion per “club”, so I assigned each of the four to the club I thought suited them best. I referenced the style of the original Battle Academia for details such as pant seams and coloured linings, and I used my knowledge of sewing to try and design realistic clothing items. The only exceptions are the “ties”, since in the ingame models they appear as part of the shirt instead of actual ties and I wanted to keep to a similar style.</p>

            <p>After all four were designed I created turnarounds for the back of the outfits and polished up the designs as a whole. Samira and Seraphine needed little to no changes, but I felt that Sett was a bit overdesigned and that Aphelios did not match his ingame model enough. To fix this I simplified Sett's shirt and completely redid Aphelios with a new silhouette. The overall goal was to have all four champions resemble their ingame silhouettes, meaning restrictions such as Seraphine having long hair and Samira having pants. I also studied Sett's silhouette to see how my design would align with his existing skins.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow-text">reflection and learnings //</span> From this mini-project I learned a lot about what goes into designing a “skinline”, even if this doesn't even scratch the work put into designing an actual one. Furthermore, if this were part of a real design process, it would be unwise for me to stop at only one or two iterations of the designs. This applies to all areas of design, and I think it's important to try and branch out to as many ideas as possible. Even if you still end up settling on the first iteration, there is knowledge gained from the designs that didn't work. With this in mind, I'm still satisfied with these “skins” as they are now and think that I've created designs that would fit into the Battle Academia universe.</p>
