            <p><span class="green-text">overview //</span> In fall 2019, despite never having animated more than a frame-to-frame animation meme before, I decided to board an animatic to the song <a class="bodylink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E286KqzpkKw"><span class="green-text"><u>RPG</u></span></a>. The premise was ridiculous but simple: “What if the K/DA members were online friends who played games together?”. After sketching the animatic it took almost two years on-and-off to complete and is my most ambitious project to date.</p>

            <div id="mainvid" class="embedvid">

            </div>

            <p><span class="green-text">process //</span> I started with a point form script of moments I wanted to include, as well as an outline of the story. After I designed the outfits I then sketched the entire animatic using the script as a guide and threw together the images in Movie Maker to get an idea of the timings. Then came the long and tedious part—actually finishing it. Every frame had to have a second clean sketch, line art, colour, and shading. I experimented with vectors for the fully animated sections which helped speed up the colouring process later on. Once everything was completed I exported the frames and backgrounds separately and edited everything together in Premiere.</p>

            <p><span class="green-text">reflection and learnings //</span> This was a crazy project and I'm so proud that I managed to finish it. I learned a lot about speeding up my workflow through shortcuts and trying out new techniques such as the vector line art. One little road bump is that Clip Studio is definitely not meant to have a long animation in one file (the lag!), so I had to periodically save as a new file and merge completed frames together. This meant if I had to go back and fix something it was a pain to find a version of the file where it wasn't merged. If I could go back I'd split it into separate files for different scenes rather than one large file.</p>

            <p class="small">mistakes were made</p>

            <p>I also learned a lot about compositing and editing. I had never video edited in a professional program like Premiere before, and it's clear in the final product I still have much to learn. It was a bit frustrating to learn keyframes and try and get the images to move how I wanted them to, and in the end it's still not perfect. However, it's a much better result than I could get with Movie Maker, and the application of those skills applies both to editing presentation videos for classes as well as my silly League highlight videos.</p>

            <p class="small">Hitfilm Express works about the same as Premiere, and is way more functional than Movie Maker</p>
